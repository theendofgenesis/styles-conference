                        <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>
                        <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning – both of code and drum beats! You’ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>

                        <h5>About Chris</h5>
                        <p>Chris Mills is a Senior Tech Writer at Mozilla, where he writes docs and demos about open web apps, Firefox OS and related subjects. He loves tinkering around with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies, and gives occasional tech talks at conferences and universities.</p>

                        <p>They’re elusive, those rare beings who do front-end development, visual design, project management, UX, content strategy, and are whizzes at user research. In an industry that’s constantly changing and evolving, there are both benefits and drawbacks to being a generalist. We’ll walk through strategies to fill gaps in your skill set while working a full-time job, and collaborative tools and techniques you can use while you quest to learn it all.</p>
